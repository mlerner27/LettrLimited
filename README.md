  To preview and run the project on your device:
  1) Open project folder in your terminal.
  2) In the terminal, run `export FLASK_APP=server` and `export FLASK_ENV=development`. Then, run `flask run`.
  3) Copy and paste the HTTP URL in browser. Currently available (static) pages are titled: /, /prefs, /archive, /bio, /msgs, /chat, /expanded, /login, /map, /personal, and /swipe.

NOTE: ONLY /archive, /swipe, and /expanded render correctly at the moment. Leveraged Locofy.ai and Anima for the HTML/CSS. We are focusing on these pages as they represent the core of our design solution, and will work on fixing the renders and JS on the other pages later if time permits.
