  To preview and run the project on your device:
  1) Open project folder in your terminal.
  2) In the terminal, run `export FLASK_APP=server` and `export FLASK_ENV=development`. Then, run `flask run`.
  3) Copy and paste the HTTP URL in browser. Currently available pages are titled: /, /prefs, /archive, /bio, /msgs, /chat, /expanded, /login, /map, /personal, and /swipe.

NOTE: Leveraged Locofy.ai and Anima for the HTML/CSS. We are focusing on the swipe, archive, and chat pages as they represent the core of our design solution, and will work on beautifying the renders and JS on the other pages later if time permits. Right now, the functionality only supports 1 listing, but our stretch goal is to work towards displaying at least two to show the part of our design solution that dictates that users be shown multiple listings at once. Core swipe functionality works but is limited in rendering ability currently.
